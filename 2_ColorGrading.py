# # Color grading with optimal transport
# 
# #### *Nicolas Courty, RÃ©mi Flamary*

#%% In this tutorial we will learn how to perform color grading of images with optimal transport. This is somehow a very direct usage of optimal transport. You will learn how to treat an image as an empirical distribution, and apply optimal transport to find a matching between two different images seens as distributions. 

# First we need to load two images. To this end we need some packages
# 

# In[1]:


import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pylab as pl
from matplotlib.pyplot import imread
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

I1 = imread('./data/klimt.jpg').astype(np.float64) / 256
I2 = imread('./data/schiele.jpg').astype(np.float64) / 256


#%% We need some code to visualize them

# In[2]:


def showImage(I,myPreferredFigsize=(8,8)):
    pl.figure(figsize=myPreferredFigsize)
    pl.imshow(I)
    pl.axis('off')
    pl.tight_layout()
    pl.show()


# In[3]:


showImage(I1)
showImage(I2)


# Those are two beautiful paintings of respectively Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele. Now we will treat them as empirical distributions.

#%% Write two functions that will be used to convert 2D images as arrays of 3D points (in the color space), and back.

# In[4]:


def im2mat(I):
    """Converts and image to matrix (one pixel per line)"""
    pass # use reshape


def mat2im(X, shape):
    """Converts back a matrix to an image"""
    pass # use reshape

X1 = im2mat(I1)
X2 = im2mat(I2)


#%% It is unlikely that our solver, as efficient it can be, can handle so large distributions (1Mx1M for the coupling). We will use the Mini batch k-means procedure from sklearn to subsample those distributions. Write the code that performs this subsampling (you can choose a size of 1000 clusters to have a good approximation of the image)

# In[5]:


import sklearn.cluster as skcluster
nbsamples=1000


#%% You can use the following procedure to display them as point clouds

# In[6]:


def showImageAsPointCloud(X,myPreferredFigsize=(8,8)):
    fig = pl.figure(figsize=myPreferredFigsize)
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    ax.set_xlim(0,1)
    ax.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], X[:,2], c=X, marker='o', alpha=1.0)
    ax.set_xlabel('R',fontsize=22)
    ax.set_xticklabels([])
    ax.set_ylim(0,1)
    ax.set_ylabel('G',fontsize=22)
    ax.set_yticklabels([])
    ax.set_zlim(0,1)
    ax.set_zlabel('B',fontsize=22)
    ax.set_zticklabels([])
    ax.grid('off')
    pl.show()


#%% You can now compute the coupling between those two distributions using the exact LP solver (EMD)

#%% using the barycentric mapping method, express the tansformation of both images into the other one

#%% Since only the centroid of clusters have changed, we need to figure out a simple way of transporting all the pixels in the original image. At first, we will apply a simple strategy where the new value of the pixel corresponds simply to the new position of its corresponding centroid

#%% Express this transformation in your code, and display the corresponding adapted image.

#%% You can use also the entropy regularized version of Optimal Transport (a.k.a. the Sinkhorn algorithm) to explore the impact of regularization on the final result
